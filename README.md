# Department of Immunology - Harvard Medical School

## Bioinformatics Resources for Immunological Research

We are a collaborative group of scientists from across the Harvard community, including the Ragon Institute, Broad Institute, and Harvard Stem Cell Institute, working to understand the mechanisms and applications of immunity and immunobiology.

### Our Mission
Advancing immunological research through:
- **Computational Tools** - Standardized analysis pipelines
- **Educational Resources** - Workshops and training materials  
- **Collaborative Science** - Open-source bioinformatics solutions
